## Settings
Since v0.4, the app supports a JSON settings file.
The file can be placed at either (in order):

- File called "windows-terminal-quake.json", next to the app .exe
- "C:\\Users\\(username)\\windows-terminal-quake.json"

WTQ also supports the extensions **.jsonc** and **.json5**, which can be useful for automatic syntax highlighting support in editors.

Changing the file automatically results in the app reloading the settings.

### Command Line Parameters

Windows Terminal supports a [set of command line parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/command-line-arguments?tabs=windows), for example to start with multiple tabs or panes.

Any arguments passed to windows-terminal-quake are passed to Windows Terminal, eg:

```powershell
windows-terminal-quake.exe split-pane
```

### Disable When Active App Is In Fullscreen

Disable toggle hotkeys when the currently focused application is on the primary monitor and is in fullscreen.

Useful for eg. when playing a game, to prevent being thrown back to the desktop when touching a hotkey.

Defaults to ```false```.

```json
{
	"DisableWhenActiveAppIsInFullscreen": false
}
```

### Hide On Focus Lost

When clicking or alt-tabbing away to another app, the terminal will automatically (and instantly) hide.

Defaults to ```true```.

```json
{
	"HideOnFocusLost": true
}
```

### Hotkeys

Multiple hot keys are supported, with an optional modifier.

```json
{
	// The keys that can be used to toggle the terminal
	"Hotkeys": [

		// Tilde, without modifiers
		{
			"Key": "OemTilde"
		},

		// Ctrl + Q
		{
			"Modifiers": "Control",
			"Key": "Q"
		},

		// Multiple modifiers
		{
			"Modifiers": "Control,Shift",
			"Key": "W"
		}
	]
}
```

#### F12 As a Hotkey

When using "F12" as a hotkey, it may be necessary to disable the key as a shortcut for the system-wide debugger first.

Since F12 is the default for the debugger, it won't respond when used in another app, such as Windows Terminal Quake, or ConEmu.

This can be done by changing the registry key at:

```
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\UserDebuggerHotKey
```

This key defaults to ```0```, which means ```F12```.

As pointed out by the ConEmu docs, it can for example be changed to the "Pause"-key (value ```13```).

A reboot may also be required, after which F12 can be used as a hotkey for toggling.

Thanks to [Luca](https://github.com/lpuglia) for pointing this out on GitHub.

### Notifications

Whether to show notifications when the app starts and when the settings are reloaded.

Defaults to ```true```.

```json
{
	"Notifications": true
}
```

### Opacity

The terminal window can be made transparent through the ```Opacity```-setting.
Note that this controls the transparency of the entire window, including the title bar.

From ```0``` (invisible) to ```100``` (opaque).

```json
{
	"Opacity": 80
}
```

### Prefer Monitor

What monitor to preferrably drop the terminal.

Can be:

- WithCursor
- Primary
- AtIndex

If ```PreferMonitor``` is set to ```AtIndex```, the ```MonitorIndex```-setting determines what monitor to choose.
Zero based, eg. 0, 1, etc.

Defaults to ```WithCursor```.

```json
{
	"PreferMonitor": "AtIndex",
	"MonitorIndex": 1
}
```

### Size & Align

#### Horizontal Align

When ```HorizontalScreenCoverage``` is below 100, this setting determines where the terminal is place horizontally.

Possible values:

- Left
- Center (default)
- Right

```json
{
	"HorizontalAlign": "Center"
}
```

**Left**
![Left](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1295673/95656847-467ed980-0b11-11eb-87a4-2bff809c30d0.png)

**Center**

#### Horizontal Screen Coverage

How much horizontal space the terminal should use. When this is below 100, the terminal is centered (can be changed using the [Horizontal Align](#horizontal-align)) setting.

This can also be above 100, which can be useful to compensate for the window not always taking a 100% of the screen width, due to the terminal being bound to column widths (eg. try 100.5 or 101).

```json
{
	"HorizontalScreenCoverage": 80
}
```

![Horizontal Coverage](https://files.flyingpie.nl/windows-terminal-quake/horizontal-coverage.png)

<span class="by">Suggested by [baslas](https://github.com/baslas)</span>

#### Vertical Offset

How much room to leave between the top of the terminal and the top of the screen.

```json
{
  // How much room to leave between the top of the terminal and the top of the screen
  "VerticalOffset": 50
}
```

#### Vertical Screen Coverage

The vertical space that is taken up by the terminal window can be configured through "VerticalScreenCoverage".

```json
{
  // How far the terminal should come down, in percentage (eg. 50 = half way, 100 = full screen)
  "VerticalScreenCoverage": 60
}
```

<span class="by">Suggested by [Neil Santos](https://github.com/nlsantos)</span>

#### Maximize After Toggle

Whether to maximize the terminal after it has toggled into view.</para>
Note that this only applies when both ```HorizontalScreenCoverage``` and ```VerticalScreenCoverage``` are at least 100.

This is to fix the issue where the terminal columns don't line up with the width and height of the screen.

Since the terminal sizes in incremental values of 1 column, 100% horizontal coverage can actually mean slightly under the full width of the screen.

Defaults to ```true```.

```json
{
	"MaximizeAfterToggle": true
}
```

### Start Hidden

Whether to hide the terminal window immediately after app start.

Defaults to ```false```.

```json
{
	"StartHidden": true
}
```

### Suppress Hotkey for Processes

The processes that suppress the hotkey bind.

Useful for cases where, when a specific program has focus, toggling of the terminal should be suspended.

Defaults to no processes.

```json
{
	"SuppressHotkeyForProcesses": [ "code.exe" ]
}
```

### Taskbar Icon Visibility

When to show the terminal window icon on the taskbar.

"AlwaysHidden", "AlwaysVisible" or "WhenTerminalVisible".

Defaults to no "AlwaysHidden".

```json
{
	"TaskbarIconVisibility": "AlwaysHidden"
}
```

### Toggle Animation

#### Toggle Animation Type

Which animation type is used during toggle up/down.

Supported values:

- Linear
- EaseInBack
- EaseInCubic
- EaseInOutSine
- EaseInQuart
- EaseOutBack
- EaseOutCubic
- EaseOutQuart

See [easings.net](https://easings.net/) for examples of the easings.

Defaults to ```EaseOutQuart```.

```json
{
	"ToggleAnimationType": "EaseOutQuart"
}
```

<span class="by">Suggested and implemented by [Tim Molderez](https://github.com/timmolderez)</span>

#### Toggle Duration

How long it should take for the terminal to come down or go back up.
This is an estimate, since because of the way the toggling works, some slow downs can happen.

Setting this to ```0``` makes the toggle instant.

```json
{
	"ToggleDurationMs": 150
}
```

<span class="by">Suggested by [Mike F](https://github.com/mikef-nl)</span>

#### Toggle Mode

How the terminal actually gets toggled on- and off the screen.

Supported values:

**Resize**

Resizes the terminal window vertically until it is either at full size, or shrunk out of the way.
This should work on any setup, but can cause some jumping of the terminal characters, such as the cursor.

**Move**

Moves the entire window off-screen to the top, which prevents jumping of the terminal characters, since the size of the terminal is kept constant.

This doesn't work too great with vertically-stacked monitor setups, since the terminal might be pushed off to the monitor north of the active one.

Defaults to ```Resize```.

```json
{
	"ToggleMode": "Resize"
}
```

#### Toggle Animation Frame Time

How long each frame in the toggle animation takes in milliseconds.
The lower this value, the smoother the animation, though values lower than 15 are not supported and will result in a toggle taking more than the configured.

Defaults to ```25```.

```json
{
	"ToggleAnimationFrameTimeMs": 25
}
```

### Windows Terminal Command

The command/file path to execute when the app starts and Windows Terminal is not yet running.

Useful for when the Windows Terminal is not in the PATH variable.
In such cases, the full path to the wt.exe executable can be used instead.

Defaults to "wt.exe".

```json
{
	"WindowsTerminalCommand": "wt.exe"
}
```
