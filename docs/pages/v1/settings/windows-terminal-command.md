# Windows Terminal Command

The command/file path to execute when the app starts and Windows Terminal is not yet running.

Useful for when the Windows Terminal is not in the PATH variable.
In such cases, the full path to the wt.exe executable can be used instead.

Defaults to "wt.exe".

```json
{
	"WindowsTerminalCommand": "wt.exe"
}
```
