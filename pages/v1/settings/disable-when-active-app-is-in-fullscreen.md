# Disable When Active App Is In Fullscreen

Disable toggle hotkeys when the currently focused application is on the primary monitor and is in fullscreen.

Useful for eg. when playing a game, to prevent being thrown back to the desktop when touching a hotkey.

Defaults to ```false```.

```json
{
	"DisableWhenActiveAppIsInFullscreen": false
}
```
