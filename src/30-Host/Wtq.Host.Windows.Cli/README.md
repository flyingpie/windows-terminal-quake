# Wtq.Host.Windows.Cli

The Windows binary compiles to a WinExe image, which spawns a window (as opposed to interacting with the command line).

For troubleshooting, it can be very useful to run WTQ from the command line. So the Wtq.Host.Windows.Cli project is a
copy of Wtq.Host.Windows, but compiles to a regular Exe (that does work on the command line).
